# ND-AME Intermediate Controls Conference (ICC)

Dear Intermediate Controls Class,

The ICC summarizes the content of our class with your final project presentations. In the near future, you will likely interact with dynamical systems. The purpose of this website is to document your progress and be a mind refresher after your graduation.

It was a pleasure working with you, and I wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

[Edgar Bolívar-Nieto](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/edgar-bolivar-nieto/)
